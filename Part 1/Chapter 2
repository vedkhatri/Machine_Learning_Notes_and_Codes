CHAPTER 2: END-TO-END MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

- Checklist for a ML project:
  1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture
    1.1. Define the objective in business terms
    1.2. How will the solution be used?
    1.3. What are the current solutions/workarounds?
    1.4. How should the problem be framed? (Supervised/Unsupervides, Online/Offline, etc.)
    1.5. How should performance be measured?
    1.6. Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?
    1.7. What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?
    1.8. What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?
    1.9. Is human expertise available?
    1.10. How would te problem be solved manually?
    1.11. List the assumptions made so far
    1.12. Verify assumptions
  2. Get the data
    2.1. 
  3. Explore the data to get insights
  4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to ML algorithms
  5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones
  6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution
  7. Present your solution
  8. Launch, monitor and maintain your system
